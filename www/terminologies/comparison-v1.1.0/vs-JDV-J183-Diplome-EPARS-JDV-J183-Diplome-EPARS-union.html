<p>
  This is the ValueSet that contains all the codes in JDV_J183_Diplome_EPARS (https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J183-Diplome-EPARS/FHIR/JDV-J183-Diplome-EPARS) and JDV_J183_Diplome_EPARS (https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J183-Diplome-EPARS/FHIR/JDV-J183-Diplome-EPARS). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
