<h2>Union of https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J65-SubjectRole-DMP/FHIR/JDV-J65-SubjectRole-DMP and https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J65-SubjectRole-DMP/FHIR/JDV-J65-SubjectRole-DMP</h2>

<p>
  This is the ValueSet that contains all the codes in JDV_J65_SubjectRole_DMP (https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J65-SubjectRole-DMP/FHIR/JDV-J65-SubjectRole-DMP) and JDV_J65_SubjectRole_DMP (https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J65-SubjectRole-DMP/FHIR/JDV-J65-SubjectRole-DMP). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
